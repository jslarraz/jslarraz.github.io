<p>This post surveys the basis of network management, discusses about how the Simple Network Management Protocol has ruled most network devices for the last 30 years and what we can expect of it in the future. </p>
<p>Back to my days at the university, when I was professor of the Network Management module, I used to start the module stating that Network Management is the combination of Network Monitoring and Network Control. While the <b>Network Monitoring</b> is devoted to gather information about the status and behaviour of the networked configuration, the <b>Network Control</b> provides the capability of changing configurations and start actions on devices, usually in response to an event detected by the monitoring. The International Organization for Standards (OSI) define a list of key functional areas of Network Management which includes fault, accounting, configuration, performance and security management.</p>
<p>With the increasing size, complexity and heterogeneity of networked installations, the cost of Network Management also rises. To control these costs, standard tools are needed to manage different product types, ranging from old-fashioned hubs to blazing-fast cloud instances, coming from different vendors and providers. In this context, the <b>Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)</b> was adopted by the industry, becoming the de-facto standard for the management of TCP/IP networks, even if the only simple thing related to it is part of its name.</p>

<h4>Simple Network Management Protocol</h4>
<p>During the past few years, there has been a lot of discussion about whether SNMP is already dead or not. Well, depends on what you mean by dead. I can agree that it is not very likely that new revisions of the protocol are going to be released in the future and, at some point, new products will drop the support for SNMP (even the universe will collapse eventually). However, even if that is the case, I have at least <b>two good reasons to do not forget about SNMP yet</b>. First, there are lot of already deployed network devices that only support SNMP as standard management option which are going to be in the field for the following 15 or 20 years. Second, SNMP framework defines everything that a good Network Management framework needs, and can be used as basis to understand newer management frameworks.</p>
<p>Two roles, agents and managers, compose the SNMP network management architecture. Each agent supports a set a managed objects, the Management Information Base (MIB), that can be monitored/controlled by the manager. The SNMP framework also define a set of rules, the Structure of Managed Information (SMI, RFC 1155), to define the managed objects contained in the MIB and a protocol to exchange this information between agents and managers (also known as SNMP). </p>

<h4>Standard MIB and RMON</h4>
<p>There are two kind of MIBs, public (a.k.a standard) and private (vendor specific) ones. Standard MIBs are key for the SNMP framework, as they allow system administrators to use the same tools and scripts among different networks; independently of which devices they are composed. All SNMP agents that claim to be compliant with the specification must implement a common set of managed objects, named MIB-II (RFC 1213), which include information relative to the system, its interfaces and the implementation and execution experience of the ip, icmp, tcp, udp, egp and snmp protocols on the system. The most important addition to the basic set of SNMP standards is the remote network monitoring (RMON). RMON was designed to provide off-line operation, proactive monitoring, problem detection and reporting, value-added data and multiple manager. I implemented the filter group of a RMON probe using python and libpcap as part of my <a href="https://zaguan.unizar.es/record/31543?ln=en">end of bachelor project</a>. It has been further updated to include SNMPv3 support and deployment using docker containers. You can find it in my github space. </p>
