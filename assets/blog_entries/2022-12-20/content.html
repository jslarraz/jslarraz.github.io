<p>Wireless devices, ranging from fitness devices that enable customers to keep track of their activity to smart heating systems that can be remotely powered on demand, have enhanced the life quality of many customers over the past years. However, the increasing number of connected devices coupled with the lack of cybersecurity regulations pose a risk that certainly cannot be overlooked.</p>

<p>To shortcut this situation, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_5634">EU Commission published a Delegated Act</a> (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2022.007.01.0006.01.ENG">2022/30/EU</a>) to the <a href="https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/sectors/electrical-and-electronic-engineering-industries-eei/radio-equipment-directive-red_en">Radio Equipment Directive</a> (RED, <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32014L0053">2014/53/EU</a>), with the aim to improve the cybersecurity of wireless devices and products on the European market. This Delegated Act enforces compliance with RED Articles 3(3)(d), (e) and (f), to improve network protection, strengthen personal data and privacy protection and reduce the risk of fraud respectively. It took effect on February 1, 2022, and will <b>become mandatory on August 1, 2024.</b></p>

<p>This amendment of the directive is extremely important for device manufacturers, as conformity with the RED is required to obtain the <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/product-requirements/labels-markings/ce-marking/index_en.htm">CE mark</a>, which in turn, is required to sell products in the European market. Manufacturers will be able to prove conformity with above-mentioned articles either through an external assessment (carried out by a notified body) or through a self-assessment, ensuring that requirements defined by the relevant harmonised standards are met.</p>

<p>On January 10, 2022, the European Commission published a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/documents/48359">draft standardization request</a>, urging the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to create a harmonised standard in support of the supplementary requirements under RED Articles 3(3)(d), (e) and (f). This harmonised standard is expected to be published in September 2023, so that no harmonized standard currently covers the scope of the RED Article 3.3.</p>

<p>Based on workshops and presentations from the European Standards Organizations (ESOs) and commission, the harmonized standards will likely be based on existing IoT cybersecurity standards <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/303600_303699/303645/02.01.01_60/en_303645v020101p.pdf">EN 303 645</a> and IEC 62443-4-2. Thus, assessing conformance with EN 303 645, through the <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103700_103799/103701/01.01.01_60/ts_103701v010101p.pdf">TS 103 701</a>, might be great way to be prepare until the harmonised standard will be released. To ease the assessment process, I have created a template to collect required Implementation eXtra Information for Testing (IXIT) and I have integrated it with the German Bundesamt f√ºr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Unternehmen-und-Organisationen/Standards-und-Zertifizierung/Consumer-IoT/Consumer-IoT_node.html">Assessment Template for Identification of the DUT, ICS and Assessment Results</a>. You can download this template from the following link and use it free of charge in your projects.</p>
